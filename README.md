Takes each row of a sudoku puzzle as input and prints true if the board is a valid solution, or false if the solution isn't correct.

# Goals

-Fix this basic idea and improve it as I get better.

# Notes
This is a base project so I can see my growth over time. I have no experience with github, and only crude puzzle solutions with python.
